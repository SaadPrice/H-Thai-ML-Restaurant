      <h2>Origin Story</h2>
      <img src="assets/images/about.jpg" alt="Seasoning">
      <p>Originally started in a grungy alley in New York City. One stormy, cold and rainy night, Mrs. Wong was closing up her stand. When a stanger asked if she was closed and if he could get a bowl of hot soup. Mrs. Wong started the fire back up again, she made "fresh" hot soup, fixed the stranger a to-go bowl, gave him the soup and the man continued on his journey. Three days later the man came back, wanting more soup and telling Mrs. Wong how this was better than his Dear Mother's. Then he said this was the best soup he ever tasted in his life! This is how the Legend of Mrs. Wong"s FAMOUS FOOD began!</p>
